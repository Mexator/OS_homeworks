The stdout stream is line-buffered. In program 1 both processes print "Hello\n" 
because after forking stdout's buffer contains "Hello". Hence, after printing 
a newline character (does not matter by whom), buffer will be flushed and output 
will be written out to terminal by both processes (and then the 2nd newline 
character will be printed). In the 2nd case flushing is done before the forking.
After fork() parent and child both print newline character and 2 empty lines appear.
