The difference between physical and virtual address is that the first 
one is address in physical memory and the second one is in virtual. Physical
address is the actual number of the memory block in main memory of the computer.
Virtual address is the convenient abstraction that allow programmer to handle
IO operations in the program address space like it is physical memory although
physical memory blocks with adjacent virual addresses (for example 0xfe and 0xff) 
can be in totally different parts of the physical memory.
