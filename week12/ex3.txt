As can bee seen from stats above, time for copying a file inversely proportional
to buffer size and becomes much greater with O_SYNC flag. 
Increasing of delay with O_SYNC flag can be explained with that waiting is done 
while disk will finish writing out the file to ensure that its content is 
consistent and until finish of this writing process is suspended. Thus, 
parallel writing is disabled with O_SYNC flag. 
Decreasing a delay with increasing buffer size can be explained with that
disk reads blocks of data simultaneously, so with increased buffer size less 
reads/writes to disk required to finish copying. (Nevertheless there is disc 
cache acquiring information from it is time-consuming, too)
